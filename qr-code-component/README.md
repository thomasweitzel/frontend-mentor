## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 3.0 utility classes
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) - Rspack Powered Build Tool

### What I learned

As a backend developer primarily working with Node.js, Rust, Java, Kotlin, and SQL, this project was an opportunity to
expand my skill set into frontend technologies. While I had some knowledge of HTML and CSS and had previously
experimented with React, I hadn't delved deeply into using these tools together in a structured project.

- React Setup: I decided to use React for all my Frontend Mentor projects to familiarize myself with building reusable
  components.
- Rsbuild vs. Vite: Instead of the popular Vite, I opted for Rsbuild, as it's Rust-powered and aligns with my interests.
- Tailwind CSS: I found Tailwind CSS to be incredibly efficient for managing styles.
- Custom Deployment: I set up my own server for live demos of solutions, learning more about deploying static frontend
  projects.

By integrating these tools, Iâ€™ve created a workflow that I plan to refine and reuse for future challenges. This process
has been a rewarding learning experience that will undoubtedly benefit future projects.
