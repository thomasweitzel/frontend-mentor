## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 3.0 utility classes
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) - Rspack Powered Build Tool

### What I learned

I'm a backend software developer, mainly using Node.js (JavaScript), Rust, Java & Kotlin, and much SQL.
Although I know a little HTML and CSS, have heard a lot about React and tried it once, I've never really gotten around using it much.

So I wanted to set up my own combination of tools for the Frontend Mentor challenges to learn HTML and CSS and all that other stuff necessary to have functioning projects.

I will make every project a React project, instead of e.g. Vite I will use Rsbuild (because of Rust, it's just what I like).
The CSS library will be Tailwind CSS.
I want to use my own server for the live demo of my solutions.

To make this all work, I had to learn everything that was necessary for that.
But it will pay off because I can use that knowledge for all the future challenges - or so I think.
