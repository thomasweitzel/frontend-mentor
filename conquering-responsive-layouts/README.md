# My Notes for Kevin Powell's Online Course: "Conquering Responsive Layouts"

- See [here](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts) for the course.
- He calls it a "drip"-course, because content is spread out over 21 days and you cannot go faster.
- This approach should give you time to practice things, which you absolutely should do!
