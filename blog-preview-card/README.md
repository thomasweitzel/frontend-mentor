## My process

Even though the project only requires plain HTML and CSS, it's built as a React application with Tailwind CSS and Rsbuild.
I do this because I think this setup will benefit me and my projects in the future. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 3.0 utility classes
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) - Rspack Powered Build Tool

### What I learned

- How to use responsive modifiers like `sm:` and `lg`.
- How to use state modifiers like `hover:`, `focus`, or `disabled`
