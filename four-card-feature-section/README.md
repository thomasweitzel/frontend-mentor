## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 3.0 utility classes
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) - Rspack Powered Build Tool

### What I learned

- A lot about Grid and Flex layouts
- How to align and justify elements with their layouts
- That I still need way more practice with these layouts to be more comfortable with them
- I do not know enough yet to solve this challenge without resorting to JavaScript;
  the challenge was labeled HTML & CSS, but I had to use JavaScript to partition the cards for the grid layout
