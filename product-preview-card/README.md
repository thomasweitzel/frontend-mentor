## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 3.0 utility classes
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) - Rspack Powered Build Tool

### What I learned

- Correct handling of breakpoints for a <something>-first approach:
  you do not include the qualifiers for this "something" in your markup.
- How to add accessibility information in the markup (`aria` - Accessible Rich Internet Applications).
- I'm starting to grasp how this whole "responsive" thing works;
  I started Kevin Powell's free online course [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts),
  even though it's spread out over 21 days.
